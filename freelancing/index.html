          <p>Currently, I'm offering 3D modeling services. If any of the models in my catalog catch your interest or you need similar custom models, continue reading below. </p>
		  <p>I'll just be creating props and static items in fantasy or abandoned world styles for the time being, similar to those in the catalog (same color palette, proportions, etc.), and I won't be creating people, animals, animated creatures, etc. This may change in the future.</p>
		  <p><b>The catalog models</b> are available for worldwide commercial non-exclusive use without any attribution requirements (ie. games, renders, etc). The only limitation is that the source files cannot be sold, shared, or redistributed in their original form; instead, they must be packaged in a closed source medium.<br>NOTE: The zip package contains information on the minimal attribution required for the free models. </p>
		  <p>Requests for <b>exclusive custom models</b> are more expensive because you get to keep the OBJ model's ownership and distribution rights (which let you do whatever you want with it); These models will never be distributed from my public catalogs (However, bear in mind that similar models could already exist or be done in the future, or could be showcased as finished works, but the source never distributed). The supplied source texture is an exception to this license; you have the unrestricted freedom to share it whatever you like as long as I retain control of the source (So I can reuse my texture base in future works). All models acquired may be used as many times as you like for the remainder of your life. 
			<br>
			<b>TLDR; You can do whatever you want with the files,</b> I won't distribute your model OBJ file, but I can keep using the textures for future works.</p>
		  <p>You can also ask for non-exclusive models (which will be added to the catalog), which will cost you the same as other non-exclusive models but allow other users to use them as well.</p>
		  <p>All my content is created using free software and does not require proprietary tools/licenses to modify. Models in .OBJ Format, and textures as .PNG files.</p>
