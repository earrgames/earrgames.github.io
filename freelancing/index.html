          <p>I'm offering 3D modeling services at the moment, if you are interested in any of my models in the catalog or need similar custom made models, keep reading below.</p>
		  <p>For the time being, I'll only be doing props/static objects in derelict/runined world or fantasy styles such as the ones in the catalog (Same color palete, proportions, etc), no persons, animals, animated creatures, etc. This may change in the future.</p>
		  <p><b>The catalog models</b> are world wide commercial non-exclusive no-attribution-required NSFW-allowed, the only restriction is that the source files cannot be sold/shared/distributed as-is; They need to be bundled in a closed source medium (ie. games, renders, etc). NOTE: The free models do requere a simple atributtion, details included in the zip file.</p>
		  <p><b>Custom exclusive models</b> request are more expensive as you will retain ownership and distribution rights of the OBJ model (meaning, you can do whatever you want with it); These models will never be included in my public catalogs for distribution (However, bear in mind that similar models could already exist or be done in the future, or could be showcased as finished works, but the source never distributed). One exception to this license, is the bundled source texture, you get the irrevocable right to distribute it as you wish, but I retain the ownership of it (So I can reuse my texture base). All adquired models can be used an infinite amount of times, for the rest of your life.
			<br>
			<b>TLDR; You can do whatever you want with the files,</b> I won't distribute your model OBJ file, but I can keep using the textures for future works.</p>
		  <p>You may request non-exclusive models too (these will go to the catalog), they will cost you the same as any other non-exclusive model, but other people will be able to use them too.</p>
		  <p>All my content is created using free software and does not require proprietary tools/licenses to modify. Models in .OBJ Format, and textures as .PNG files.</p>
